## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Staff Backend Engineer & Senior Engineering Leader** with **17+
years** building **high-performance, mission-critical distributed
systems** in **Golang** and **Java**.\
My work spans fintech, industrial IoT, fraud prevention, and global SaaS
platforms --- always with a focus on:

-   ⚡ **Low-latency microservices** (sub-50ms p99)\
-   🧵 **Concurrency, multithreading & event-driven architectures**\
-   ☁️ **Massive-scale cloud-native platforms (AWS, Kubernetes,
    Terraform, GitOps)**\
-   🌎 **Leading and mentoring LATAM engineering teams (10--15
    engineers)**\
-   📈 **Modernization, cost optimization, and reliability improvements
    at scale**

I build systems that **move millions of events per day**, **scale to
millions of RPS**, and stay **observable, predictable, and blazing
fast** --- even under extreme load.\
And I deeply enjoy defining standards, building engineering culture, and
mentoring future tech leaders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Currently Working On

-   🌐 Leading architecture & engineering for a global **industrial IoT
    platform** handling 10M+ events/day\
-   🔥 Modernizing legacy architectures into **cloud-native
    microservices** (Java 17, Golang, WebFlux)\
-   🧭 Strengthening my executive tech leadership path (Principal →
    Director → CTO)\
-   📘 Mastering large-scale distributed systems, observability, and
    high-performance design\
-   🧑‍🏫 Mentoring engineers in **architecture, leadership, and
    high-performance backend engineering**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏆 Engineering Impact (Highlights)

-   🚀 **p99 latency \< 50ms** at millions of requests per second\
-   💰 **25--40% cloud cost reduction** through platform rewrites and
    tuning\
-   🧩 Reduced **MTTR by 35%** via observability and incident response
    improvements\
-   🏗️ Modernized monoliths into **40+ microservices** using Java 17 +
    Spring Boot 3 + WebFlux\
-   ⚡ Introduced Golang to critical workloads → **45% latency
    improvement** & major compute savings\
-   📦 Standardized **Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis, OpenTelemetry, GitOps**
    across squads and regions
